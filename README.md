## Objective

### Description
A decentralized library platform leveraging blockchain technology to provide uncensorable access to educational resources while promoting sustainable digital infrastructure. The system combines Ethereum smart contracts with IPFS storage to create a transparent, user-owned knowledge repository that eliminates single points of failure and reduces environmental impact through paperless operations.

### Key Features
- NFT-based access control for premium resources
- Learn-to-Earn reward system with verifiable credentials
- Live class streaming integration using Livepeer
- GHG reduction tracking dashboard
- Decentralized content moderation through DAO

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Frontend**: React + Ethers.js for wallet integration
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express middleware
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum smart contracts (Solidity)
- **Storage**: IPFS/Filecoin cluster

## Implementation Strategy

### Blockchain Layer
- ERC-721 contracts for resource access control
- Gas-optimized transaction workflows
- All team members collaborate on contract development

## Workflow
1. User connects Web3 wallet
2. Smart contract verifies NFT ownership
3. Content served from IPFS via backend
4. Learning activities trigger NFT rewards
